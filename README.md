# dbproject
We have deployed our code and have a live website. It can be accessed at: http://veshei.pythonanywhere.com/  In order to create/update/delete an event, you have to click the lock in the top right corner. This will bring you to a log-in page and underneath there is a register link for all new users to create their own username and password. After creating a user profile for yourself, you will be directed to the login page. Login with the new credentials you just made and you will be able to view the list of events for the overall community and for each specific organization. After logging in you can create/update/delete an event. 

In order to run the zip file with our code, the user first needs to go into their terminal and change directories into the dbproject folder with our code. Once they are in this directory, they need to run the virtual environment with the command “source dbvenv/bin/activate” (dbvenv is the name of our virtual environment in the zip file. If the virtual environment does not exist, then the user needs to create the virtual environment. That is done by doing “python -m venv myvenv” (myvenv represents whatever name you want to give to your virtual environment). After that, running the virtual environment is as simple as  “source dbvenv/bin/activate”. After you are in your virtual environment, you need to install django and mysql. Firstly, make sure that pip is up to date with the command “pip install --upgrade pip”. Then do “pip install django”. After that command, do “pip install mysqlclient”, because we are not using the default database of sqlite3 but instead are using the full mysql version. If you run into issues with the database connection, you need to go into the settings.py file in the aa_calendar folder and update the “DATABASES” portion to connect to your local database (if you are accessing the website through our live online website, you do not need to worry about this). If all else fails, you can switch back to the default sqlite3 database and everything should still work. 

Once you have all the settings configured, you can run the server on your local host network. Do “pwd” to make sure you are still in the dbproject folder (the folder with the manage.py file in it). Then do “python manage.py runserver”, which will run the server and setup the connection. In your web browser, input the url: “http://127.0.0.1:8000” to go to the website. The local host website should look the same as the live website. If you wish to access the admin site, you can type “http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin”. In order to sign in on the admin page, you need to create a superuser in your terminal. So open a new tab in your terminal (not the tab that is running the server) and type “python manage.py createsuperuser”. This should come up with 3 prompts asking for your username, email address, and password (it will ask for your password twice as a verification method). Once you create the superuser successfully, you can use those credentials to log into the admin page. In the admin page, it provides another check that all the data in the database is being updated, along with the views being propagated to the main website.
